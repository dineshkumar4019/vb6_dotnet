# Legacy Monorepo (Sample)
This repository is a deliberately diverse legacy-style monorepo for testing, learning, and migration exercises.
It contains samples of older technologies including VB6-like project files, .NET Framework 2.0/3.5/C# projects,
classic ASP, SQL scripts, shell/batch scripts, and helper libraries.

**Structure (excerpt):**
- vb6_app/                (VB6-like project with .vbp, .frm, .bas)
- dotnet_3_5/             (C# Console app targeting .NET Framework 3.5)
- vb_net_old/             (VB.NET WinForms targeting .NET 2.0 style)
- asp_classic/            (Classic ASP .asp + include files)
- sql/                    (DDL and stored procedures)
- scripts/                (build/deploy helper scripts)
- docs/                   (architecture notes)

Use this repo for practicing static analysis, migration to modern stacks, dependency discovery, and monorepo tooling tests.
